Privacy Policy Justification Worksheet
1.         Briefly describe the website you are building (its purpose/functionality/etc.)
 We are building a movie website which users can use to find their interested movies and interact with others. To be specific, users can create their accounts, search movies, like, rate, comment, and bookmark movies. One user can also see other user’s page as well, such as a list of their favorite movies.


2.         Identify the stakeholders (direct and indirect) whose interests are relevant to your website.
       Direct: users/employees (like us developers)
       Indirect: movie API service
 
3.         What data will you have access to, and what might this data reveal about its subjects?
 
      We’ll have access to users’ registered usernames, emails, passwords, locations, bios, movie collections, reviews, and articles. These users’ data may reveal about users’ interests on movies, the behavior pattern on leaving a review or writing an article about certain kinds of movies, location distribution of users etc.


4.         What values are relevant to your website and its privacy policy? (Note that the relevant values will depend in part on the kind of website you are building).
 
        Most importantly, users’ data privacy


5.         What counts as “success” for the website you are building?
 
For users, keeping their data private and editable as they like, search/comment/like as they like would be the “success”.
 
For developers, the good implementation of all the functionality of the website.
 
For the movie API service, positive feedback when fetching the data.
6.         Describe how you took the relevant values into account in writing your privacy policy (e.g. what decisions and tradeoffs were made, and why).
